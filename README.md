# LogDog - logcat syntax highlighting for vim

There are not that many plugins that try to make it easy to read logcat output
in vim, and the ones that are around are not so easy on the eyes. This plugin
tries to highlight logcat traces in a similar way to how Android Studio's
builtin logcat viewer displays them. The one in AS is more sophisticated, and
you could just use that one, but comparing multiple logs is not so easy and it
the logs can easily be deleted accidentally.
